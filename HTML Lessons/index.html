    <h1>Muhammad Ali</h1>

    <p>
        Muhammad Ali was an American
        professional boxer and social activist. A global cultural icon, widely known by the epithet "The Greatest",
        he is often regarded as the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time. He held the Ring magazine heavyweight title
        from 1964 to 1970, was the undisputed champion from 1974 to 1978, and was the WBA and Ring heavyweight champion
        from 1978 to 1979. In 1999, he was named Sportsman of the Century by Sports Illustrated and the Sports
        Personality of the Century by the BBC.

    <p>
        Born in Louisville, Kentucky, he began training as an amateur boxer at age 12. At 18, he won a gold medal in the
        light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics and turned professional later that year. He joined the
        Nation of Islam in the early 1960s, but later disavowed it in the mid-1970s. He won the world heavyweight
        championship, defeating Sonny Liston in a major upset on February 25, 1964, at age 22. During that year, he
        denounced his birth name as a "slave name" and formally changed his name to Muhammad Ali. In 1967, Ali refused
        to be drafted into the military, owing to his religious beliefs and ethical opposition to the Vietnam War, and
        was found guilty of draft evasion and stripped of his boxing titles. He stayed out of prison while appealing the
        decision to the Supreme Court, where his conviction was overturned in 1971. He did not fight for nearly four
        years and lost a period of peak performance as an athlete. Ali's actions as a conscientious objector to the
        Vietnam War made him an icon for the larger counterculture of the 1960s generation, and became a prominent,
        high-profile figure of racial pride for African Americans during the civil rights movement and throughout his
        career.

    <h2>Early Life</h2>

    <p>
        Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.[8] was born on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky.[9] The elder of
        two sons, he was named after his father, Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr.,[10][11] who himself was named in honor of
        the 19th-century Republican politician and staunch abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay. Clay's father's paternal
        grandparents were John Clay and Sallie Anne Clay; Clay's sister Eva claimed that Sallie was a native of
        Madagascar.[12] He was a descendant of slaves of the antebellum South, and was predominantly of African descent,
        with Irish[13] and English heritage.[14][15] His maternal great-grandfather, Abe Grady, emigrated from Ennis,
        County Clare, Ireland.[16][17] DNA testing performed in 2018 showed that, through his paternal grandmother, Clay
        was a descendant of the former slave Archer Alexander, the model of a freed man for the Emancipation Memorial
        and the subject of abolitionist William Greenleaf Eliot's book, The Story of Archer Alexander: From Slavery to
        Freedom.[18]
